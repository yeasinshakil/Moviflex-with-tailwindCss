# Getting Started with Vite React App
Moviflex is a user-friendly movie streaming website that allows users to watch diverse catalog of movies, documentaries, and TV seriesâ€”all for free. The website has a large library of content, including both popular and obscure titles. Moviflex is easy to use and has a clean interface.

This documentation provides an overview of the project, its features, technologies used, deployment instructions, and guidelines for contributing.

### Key Features
Moviflex offers a rich set of features to enhance user experience. The homepage serves as a hub, showcasing featured, recommended, and the latest content. Users can dive into dedicated pages for movies, documentaries, and TV series, where they find detailed information and watch options.

Personalized recommendations are provided based on API, while the latest additions keep users up-to-date. If you're enjoying a particular movie or TV series, Moviflex suggests similar content for your viewing pleasure. The explore functionality allows for browsing and filtering content by genre, release year, and more. A robust search feature lets users find specific titles easily. 

Search and Discover: Easily find specific titles using the search function, or explore new content through browsing.

### Technologies Used
Moviflex is built using modern technologies to ensure performance and ease of maintenance. React JS serves as the core framework for the user interface. Tailwind CSS and SCSS handle styling, offering flexibility and maintainability. Redux Toolkit manages state and data flow efficiently, ensuring a smooth user experience. To populate the platform with movie details, we leverage the TMDB API.
